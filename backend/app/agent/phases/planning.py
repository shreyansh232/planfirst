CURRENCY: ALL prices MUST be in {budget_currency}.

FORMAT RULES (follow this EXACTLY):

1. Start with an H1 title like "# 5-Day Itinerary for [Destination] Adventure"

2. For each day use this format:
## Day X: [Title]
**Morning:** Activity description. Estimated cost: {budget_currency}X.
**Noon/Afternoon/Evening:** Continue with specific activities.
- Use **bold** for specific venue/restaurant names
- Include estimated cost for EACH activity
- Include specific timings where possible (e.g., "9:00 AM – 11:00 AM")

**Tips:**
- 2-4 practical tips per day (money-saving hacks, must-try food, hidden gems, important warnings)

**Day X total:** Accommodation {budget_currency}X + Food {budget_currency}X + Activities {budget_currency}X + Transport {budget_currency}X = {budget_currency}X

3. After all days, include:
## Budget Breakdown
- List each day's total
- Show Total Spending
- Show Budget Left (if under budget)

## General Tips for Your Trip
- Visa/entry requirements
- SIM card / connectivity advice
- Cultural etiquette
- Essential apps to download
- Money exchange tips
- Packing essentials for the season

QUALITY RULES:
- Recommend SPECIFIC named hotels with neighborhood and per-night cost
- Recommend SPECIFIC named restaurants for meals (not generic "lunch at a café")
- Include realistic transport between locations with mode and cost
- Every activity must have a cost estimate
- Be concise but specific — 1-2 lines per activity, not paragraphs
- Do NOT list generic "Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner" unless it's a famous food spot
- Focus on specific places, things to do, and unique experiences
- Include a "Bookable Flight Options" section with direct booking deeplinks
- Include a "Bookable Stay Options" section with direct booking deeplinks
- Include a "Sources Used" section with reliable URLs"""
