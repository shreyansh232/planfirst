Use this when you need:
- Flight prices (search for "round trip flights <origin> to <dest> <month> <year> price")
- Train ticket prices for Indian travel (search for "Indian Railways train ticket <origin> to <dest> <class> <month> <year> price IRCTC")
- Hotel/hostel prices (search for "<dest> hotel prices per night <month> <year>")
- Activity costs, entry fees, transport costs
- Visa requirements, travel advisories, weather
- Event dates, ticket prices

TIPS FOR BETTER PRICE RESULTS:
- Include the currency (e.g. "INR", "USD", "JPY")
- Include the month and year
- Include "price" or "cost" in the query
- Search for specific sites: "skyscanner", "booking.com", "google flights", "IRCTC", "railwire"
- Example: "round trip flights Mumbai to Tokyo March 2026 price INR skyscanner"
- Example: "Indian Railways train ticket Delhi to Mumbai Sleeper class 2026 price IRCTC"
